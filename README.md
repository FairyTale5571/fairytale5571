I am 28 years old and live in Kyiv, Ukraine.
I work at [PrivatBank](https://privatbank.ua), the largest bank in the country, and I'm a tech-lead in one of the leading cryptocurrency communities, [A01K](https://a01k.io).
My work is closely related to programming, and I particularly enjoy when my code helps to increase the incomes of clients.
I always work in a team and am glad to be part of any community involved in the development of products.
In programming, I prefer to use Golang and also work with databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
In my free time, I sometimes focus on developing for open-source projects, allowing me to share knowledge and contribute to the community.
I appreciate being part of a professional community where I can grow and help others.
